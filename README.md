# Face Recognition With Attendance

In this project I've tried to develop a python project to detect faces of students and mark their attendance(name and time) into a CSV file. The logic is very simple, and goes along the concept of encoding the image, and computing the similarity using distances of the image, if the match is successful, the name of the student is logged into the CSV file.

[For Reference](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78)

For the code to work successfully we should include the following libraries:
- cmake
- dlib 
- face-recognition
- numpy 
- opencv-python

These dependancies can easily be installed using PyCharm IDE.
